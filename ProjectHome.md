Trinidad is an in-process test runner for [FitNesse](http://www.fitnesse.org) tests. Here are some cool things you can do with it:

  * run fitnesse fit and slim tests without starting the server as part of your build
  * run fitnesse tests from JUnit within your IDE
  * debug and troubleshoot fitnesse fixtures in-process as if you were working with unit tests
  * easily include fitnesse acceptance tests into your build (through JUnit)
  * easily run tests in transactions and roll back after each test (with Spring)
  * execute fitnesse tests from maven
